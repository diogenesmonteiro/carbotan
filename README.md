# carbotan
Legacy software written in BASIC. Fuel distributor inventory control. QBASIC IDE included.
The input is the height of the surface of the fuel in horizontal cylindrical tanks.
I did this for a friend when I was 16 years old while learning programming by myself at home. 

The code is on CARBOTAN.BAS. It can be opened with any text editor.
