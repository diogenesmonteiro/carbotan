'''OUT''' writes values to register or port hardware addresses. '''QB64 currently has limited access to registers!'''



{{PageSyntax}}
:: OUT address%, value%


* The ''address'' is an integer value expressed as decimal or Hexadecimal.
* '''WARNING!''' Be sure that the address is useable. OUT accesses directly unlike [[POKE]] and can cause permanent PC damage!
* Values sent are normally only 0 to 255 per one byte register(8 bits) address.
* [[_PALETTECOLOR]] can also be used to set RGB intensity values using [[_RGB32|32 bit color]] values.


:::::::'''Color Port access using OUT'''

:::::OUT &amp;H3C7, attribute : Set port to read RGB settings
:::::OUT &amp;H3C8, attribute : Set port to write RGB settings
:::::OUT &amp;H3C9, color_intensity : Writes settings
:::::[[INP]] &amp;H3C9, color_intensity : Reads settings
::::* Every 3 reads or writes, changes to next color attribute
::::* Color setting is Red, Green and Blue intensities in order
::::* Color attribute intensity values range from 0 to 63 only
::::* Some [[DAC]] color attribute intensities cannot be changed using OUT.


''Example 1:'' Reading the default RGB color settings of color attribute 15.

{{CodeStart}} '' ''
{{Cl|OUT}} &amp;H3C7, 15      'set color port attribute 15 for a read
red% = {{Cl|INP}}(&amp;H3C9)
green% = INP(&amp;H3C9)
blue% = INP(&amp;H3C9)
PRINT red%, green%, blue% '' ''
{{CodeEnd}}
{{OutputStart}}
 63       63       63
{{OutputEnd}}


''Example 2:'' Changing the color intensity settings of the [[SCREEN]] background [[COLOR]] 0 to bright white.
{{CodeStart}} '' ''
{{Cl|OUT}} &amp;H3C8, 0
{{Cl|OUT}} &amp;H3C9, 63 'red
{{Cl|OUT}} &amp;H3C9, 63 'green
{{Cl|OUT}} &amp;H3C9, 63 'blue '' ''
{{CodeEnd}}
:''Explanation:'' In [[SCREEN]] 0 this is one way to make high intensity background colors. [[COLOR]] ,15 is actually grey(7).


''Example 3:'' Restoring colors to a bitmap from the Red, Green and Blue [[BSAVE]]d indexed array of color values.
{{CodeStart}} '' ''
 {{Cl|SCREEN (statement)|SCREEN}} 12
 {{Cl|OUT}} {{Cl|&amp;H}}3C8, 0 ' set color port for output at attribute 0
 {{Cl|FOR...NEXT|FOR}} i = 0 {{Cl|TO}} 47 ' 48 RGB values is (3 * 16) -1 color attributes from 0 in screen 12
   {{Cl|OUT}} {{Cl|&amp;H}}3C9, Image%(i) ' changes to next attribute after 3 RGB loops
 {{Cl|NEXT}}
 {{Cl|PUT (graphics statement)|PUT}}(clm, row), Image(48) PSET '' ''
{{CodeEnd}}
:''Explanation:'' The color RGB intensity settings were imported from a file to the Image array using {{KW|BLOAD}}. The color attribute advances to the next one every 3 writes using OUT. The color information was indexed to the start of the array. The image is after the color settings at index 48. Index 48 is the [[GET (graphics statement)|GET]] image width and 49 is the height.
