The '''OR''' coditional operator adds an alternative in a [[IF...THEN]] or [[Boolean]] statement.



* OR adds an alternative to another conditional evaluation. IF True then the statement evaluation is True.
* Parenthesis may be used to clarify an evaluation.
* Can be confused with the [[OR]] numerical operator.
