The '''LINE''' statement is used in graphics [[SCREEN (statement)|SCREEN]] modes to create lines or boxes.



{{PageSyntax}}
: LINE [STEP](column1, row1)-[STEP](column2, row2), color%[, [{B|BF}]][, style%]


* Can use [[STEP]] keyword for graphics coordinates relative to a previously placed objects.
* Creates a colored line from coordinate1 to coordinate2 if the box options(B or BF) are omitted. Can be drawn partially offscreen.
* Creates a colored box outline if the '''B''' option is used.
* Creates a color filled box if the '''BF''' option is used.
* Style is any [[INTEGER]] value from 0 to 32767. It creates dashed lines or box outlines. The Box comma is required with style even when not creating a box. The lines are created where the style value's bits are on. '''BF cannot be used with style.'''
* '''LINE can be used in any graphic screen mode, but cannot be used in the default screen mode 0 as it is text only!''' 


''Example:'' Creating styled lines and boxes with the LINE statement. Different style values create different dashed line spacing.
