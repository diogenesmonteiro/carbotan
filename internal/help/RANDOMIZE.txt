'''RANDOMIZE''' is used with a seed value to generate different random number sequences using the [[RND]] function.


{{PageSyntax}}
:: '''RANDOMIZE''' [USING] '''''seednumber'''''


* The ''seed number'' can be any positive or negative numerical value. The [[TIMER]] value is often used to change [[RND]] output each run.
* If the ''seed number'' is omitted, the program will display: '''Random-number seed (-32768 to 32767)?''' request on screen.
* '''USING''' resets a ''seed number'' sequence to the start of the sequence as if the program just started using that seed in '''QB64 only'''.
* '''Note:''' The RANDOMIZE USING ''seed number'' MUST be designated or a {{text|Name already in use|blue}} status error will occur! 
* If the same initial seed number is used, the sequence of random numbers returned will be identical every program run.
* The fact that random numbers would always be the same has been used for simple data encrytion.
* Using a [[TIMER]] starting value ensures that the initial return sequence values are different almost every time the program is run!
* [[RUN]] should reset the [[RANDOMIZE]] sequence to the starting [[RND]] function value.(Not yet in QB64)


''Example 1:'' Using RANDOMIZE '''TIMER''' to set a different starting sequence of [[RND|random]] numbers every run.
{{CodeStart}} '' ''
{{Cl|RANDOMIZE}} {{Cl|TIMER}}
{{Cl|DO...LOOP|DO}}
randnum% = INT({{Cl|RND}} * 11) + 2  'add one to multiplier as INT rounds down and never equals 10

:''Explanation:'' Procedure generates random integer values from 2 to 12 like a pair of dice.


''Example 2:'' Repeating a random number sequence with RANDOMIZE '''USING''' and a specific seed value in '''QB64''' only.
{{CodeStart}} '' ''
seed = 10
{{Cl|RANDOMIZE}} seed
Print7
{{Cl|RANDOMIZE}} seed
Print7
{{Cl|PRINT}} &quot;Press a key to start sequence over!&quot;
K$ = {{Cl|INPUT$}}(1) 
{{Cl|RANDOMIZE}} '''USING''' seed
Print7

{{Cl|SUB}} Print7
{{Cl|FOR...NEXT|FOR}} r = 1 TO 7
  {{Cl|PRINT}} {{Cl|RND}};
{{Cl|NEXT}}
{{Cl|PRINT}}: {{Cl|PRINT}}
{{Cl|END SUB}} '' ''
{{CodeEnd}}
: ''Explanation:'' The second RANDOMIZE statement just continues the sequence where USING in the third restarts the sequence.
