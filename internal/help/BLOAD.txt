{{KW|BLOAD}} loads a binary graphics file created by {{KW|BSAVE}} to an array. 


{{PageSyntax}}
::: '''BLOAD {{Parameter|Filename$}}, {{KW|VARPTR}}({{Parameter|ImageArray%(index)}})'''



{{PageDescription}}
* {{Parameter|Filename$}} is the name of the file that the image should be saved to.
* {{Parameter|ImageArray%(index)}} is the Integer array that holds the image you want to save.
* There MUST be an Integer array of adequate size (up to 26K) to hold the graphic data!
* A {{KW|DEF SEG}} pointing to the array is required. {{KW|DEF SEG}} = {{KW|VARSEG}}(ImageArray%(index))
* {{Parameter|index}} is the starting image element of the Array. Can also include RGB color settings at the start index.
* Fullscreen images in {{KW|SCREEN}} 12 require 3 file {{KW|BLOAD}}s. A 26K array can hold 1/3 of screen.
* Custom RGB color settings can be embedded(indexed) at the start of the image array. 
* {{KW|BLOAD}} Can be used to load any arrays that was saved with {{KW|BSAVE}}, not just graphics.
* Array sizes are limited to 32767 Integer elements due to use of {{KW|VARPTR}} in QB and '''QB64'''!.
* '''QB64''' can load larger arrays directly to and from binary files using {{KW|PUT}} # and {{KW|GET}} #. 


''Example 1:'' Loading data to an array from a BSAVED file.
{{CodeStart}} '' ''
 {{Cl|DEF SEG}} = {{Cl|VARSEG}}(Array(0))
   {{Cl|BLOAD}} filename$, {{Cl|VARPTR}}(Array({{Cl|LBOUND}}(Array))) ' changeable index
 {{Cl|DEF SEG}} '' ''
{{CodeEnd}}
:''Explanation:'' Referance any type of array that matches the data saved. Can work with Integer, Single, Double, Long, fixed length Strings or {{KW|TYPE}} arrays. {{KW|LBOUND}} determines the starting offset of the array or another index could be used.


''Example 2:'' Using a QB default colored image.  
{{CodeStart}} '' ''
 {{Cl|DEF SEG}} = {{Cl|VARSEG}}(Image%(0)) ' pointer to first image element of an array
   {{Cl|BLOAD}} FileName$, {{Cl|VARPTR}}(Image%(0)) ' place data into array at index position 0
   {{Cl|PUT (graphics statement)|PUT}}(Col, Row), Image%(0), PSET ' Put the image on the screen from index 0
 {{Cl|DEF SEG}} '' ''
{{CodeEnd}}
: ''Note:'' [[PSET]] is used as a [[PUT (graphics statement)|PUT]] action that places the image over any background objects.
