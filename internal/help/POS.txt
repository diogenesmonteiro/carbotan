The '''POS''' function returns the current print cursor text column position.


{{PageSyntax}}
:: column% = POS(0)


* The value in parenthesis should be 0, but any value could be used with same results. Don't ask why...
* When a semicolon ends the previous PRINT statement the cursor column position will be after the last character printed.
* If [[TAB]] or a comma is used the column position will be immediately after the tabbed position.
* If a [[PRINT]] statement does not use a semicolon or comma at the end, the return value will be 1 on the next row.
* Return can be saved to return later to a previous print position using [[LOCATE]].
