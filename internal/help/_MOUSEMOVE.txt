The '''_MOUSEMOVE''' statement moves the mouse pointer to a new position on the screen as determined by the column and row coordinates.


{{PageSyntax}} 
:::'''_MOUSEMOVE ''column%'', ''row%'''''


{{Parameters}}
* [[INTEGER]] ''column'' is the horizontal pixel coordinate to place the mouse pointer and can be any value from 0 to [[_WIDTH (function)|_WIDTH]](0) - 1.
* [[INTEGER]] ''row'' is the vertical pixel position to place the mouse pointer and can be any value from 0 to [[_HEIGHT]](0) - 1


''Usage:''
* Maximum coordinate values are based on a program's current [[SCREEN]] mode resolution or the pixel size set by [[_NEWIMAGE]].
* [[SCREEN]] 0 uses text block coordinates. '''Coordinates off of the screen will create an &quot;Illegal Function Call&quot; [[ERROR Codes|ERROR]]!'''
* Can be used to position the pointer to a default dialog button or move the cursor away from a button so it is not clicked twice.
* Does NOT require [[_MOUSEINPUT]] to be used, but all moves will be remembered by it.
