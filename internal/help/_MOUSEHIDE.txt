The '''_MOUSEHIDE''' statement hides the mouse cursor.


{{PageSyntax}}
:&lt;code&gt;{{KW|_MOUSEHIDE}}&lt;/code&gt;


''Usage:''
* Simply call the sub wherever necessary.
* Since the mouse pointer does not interfere with screen changes in '''QB64''', there is little use in hiding the pointer.
* QB64 can even use [[PSET]] and [[POINT]] without hiding the mouse pointer.
* _MOUSEHIDE statements do not accumulate like they did with [[ABSOLUTE]] or [[INTERRUPT]] in Qbasic.
