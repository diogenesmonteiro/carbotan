The '''_MOUSESHOW''' statement displays the mouse cursor.


{{PageSyntax}}
::: '''_MOUSESHOW'''


''Usage:''
* Simply use the statement whenever [[_MOUSEHIDE]] has been used previously.
* This statement can also disable [[_MOUSEMOVEMENTX]] or [[_MOUSEMOVEMENTY]] relative mouse movement reads.
* The mouse cursor will not interfere with any print or graphic screen changes in '''QB64'''.
* _MOUSEHIDE statements do not accumulate like they did with [[ABSOLUTE]] or [[INTERRUPT]] in Qbasic.
